## My process

See what parts are grouped together and from outwards to inwards. Start with the styles that affect everything and than work my way towards the more specific things. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Using the dev tools to de bug css is very helpful

### Continued development

Will get better at class names
